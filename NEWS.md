# fmtr 1.5.4

* Added FAQ and Complete Example to vignettes.
* Took out errors on convenience functions if data frame does not have a variable
specified on the incoming list.  Now this situation is ignored, and no error
is generated. The error was removed to allow the list to contain more 
formats/labels/etc. than exist on the data frame, but still assign the matching
items.

works with integer, numeric, and date vectors also.


# fmtr 1.5.1

* Fixed bug when vector format has no corresponding input value.  Was assigning
  an NA.  Now leaving the original value.
