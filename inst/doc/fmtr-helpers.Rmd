### Formatting Helper Functions

The **fmtr** package also contains several formatting helper functions.  These
functions help with common formatting styles seen in statistical reports.
For example, a range from 1 to 10 is commonly displayed as "1 - 10", with a 
hyphen separating the minimum from the maximum.  To accomplish this formatting
easily, the package provides a `fmt_range()` function that both calculates
the range and formats it in the desired manner.

Below is a complete list of the formatting helper functions.  See the help 
documentation for additional details:

* `fmt_range()`
* `fmt_n()`
* `fmt_quantile_range()`
* `fmt_median()`
* `fmt_cnt_pct()`
* `fmt_mean_sd()`
