\title{Apply formatting to two vectors}
\usage{
fapply2(
  x1,
  x2,
  format1 = NULL,
  format2 = NULL,
  sep = "",
  width = NULL,
  justify = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{A vector, factor, or list to apply the format1 to.}

\item{x2}{A second vector, factor, or list to which format2 will be applied.}

\item{format1}{A format to be applied to the first input.}

\item{format2}{A format to be applied to the second input.}

\item{sep}{A separator to use between the two formatted values.  Default
is an empty string (""), meaning there is no separator.}

\item{width}{The desired character width of the formatted vector.  Default
value is NULL, meaning the vector will be variable width.}

\item{justify}{Whether to justify the return vector.  Valid values are 
'left', 'right', 'center', 'centre', or 'none'.}
}
\value{
A vector of formatted values.
}
\description{
The \code{fapply2} function applies formatting to two different vectors, and 
combines them into a single vector.  This function is useful in cases
where your data is in two different variables, and you would like them
displayed as a single column for reporting purposes. For example, if you
wish to create one column to display mean and standard deviation.
}
\details{
The \code{fapply2} function works nearly the same as \code{\link{fapply}}.
The difference is it has parameters for two vectors and formats instead of one.  
The output of the function
is a single vector. The function essentially calls \code{\link{fapply}} 
on each vector and pastes them together afterwards.

There is an additional \code{sep} parameter so you can
define a separator between the two formatted values. 
The \code{width} and \code{justify} parameters
will apply to the single vector result.  The function will also
pick up format attributes on the supplied vectors.  

The \code{fapply2} function accepts any of the format types 
that \code{\link{fapply}} accepts.
See \code{\link{fapply}} for additional information on the types
of formats that can be applied.

Parameters may also be passed as attributes on the vector.  See 
the \code{\link{fattr}} function for additional information on setting
formatting attributes.

\examples{
# Create sample data
dt <- c(2.1, 5, 6, 9, 2, 7, 3)

# Calculate mean and standard deviation
v1 <- mean(dt)
v2 <- sd(dt)

# Apply formats and combine
fapply2(v1, v2, "\%.1f", "(\%.2f)", sep = " ")
# [1] "4.9 (2.66)"
}
